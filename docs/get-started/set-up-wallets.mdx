title: "Set Up Wallets"
---

Working with Every Protocol typically involves interacting with two types of chains:

* The universe chain (such as Ethereum or Base)
* The observer chain (Every Network)

Every Network supports [unified accounts](/network/accounts), allowing users to use the same address and private key as on their preferred universe chains.

You can either import an existing account or create a new one, using a wallet extension or the CLI.

## Use Wallet Extensions

We recommend installing one of the following browser wallet extensions:

* [SubWallet](https://subwallet.app)
* [Talisman](https://talisman.xyz)

These extensions support both Substrate accounts and Ethereum accounts.

You can:

* Create a new wallet from scratch
* Import an existing wallet using your seed phrase or private key

## Using the CLI

You can also generate or import a wallet in your terminal using the `every` CLI:

### Install every-cli

```bash
npm i @everyprotocol/every-cli
```

### Generate a new wallet

```bash
every wallet generate
```

### Import an existing wallet

```bash
every wallet --import
```

## Get Testnet Tokens

Once your wallet is set up, you can request testnet tokens:

1. Visit [Every faucet](https://faucet.every.fun)
2. Paste your wallet address and click the request button

## Check Your Balance

To view your account balances, you can use either the Developer Portal or CLI.

### Developer Portal

* Open the [Developer Portal](https://portal.every.fun)
* Navigate to **Accounts** => **Accounts**
* Youâ€™ll see balances for all accounts injected by your wallet

You can also check the balance of any address manually:

* Go to **Accounts** => **Address Book**
* Add a new contact and enter the address you're interested in

### CLI

```bash
every wallet balance
```

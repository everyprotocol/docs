# Every

A new paradigm of co-creation.

## Why Every

Today, when creating an NFT, almost all collaboration happens offchain — involving roles like artist, developer, and engineer. It’s difficult for any single role to get started alone.

Once minted, the token usually becomes a static snapshot: it cannot safely evolve or interact with other tokens. To remix or re-create it, creators must often seek permission, gather the original materials, and repeat another round of offchain coordination — a process that can hold back further creation.

With fungible tokens moving billions, DeFi automating value, and AI creating at massive scale, creators — human and AI alike — deserve a far better onchain environment for co-creation.

## What Every Is

Every, at its core, is a protocol supported by a dedicated blockchain, allowing creators to build effortlessly and trustlessly on their favorite chains with a new class of tokens — tokens that can evolve, connect, and inspire new creative possibilities.

Every consists of three core components:

- **Object Token** — A token standard for onchain assets that evolve and connect  
- **Every Protocol** — A protocol that facilitates co-creation with object tokens
- **Every Network** — A blockchain that powers object tokens on your favorite chains

Together, they form a space where creators publish their outputs as reusable primitives, compose them into new works, and let those works evolve and interact with others — all in a way that is verifiable, traceable, and frictionless.

## Start Building

You can begin with the concepts to understand the primitives behind object tokens, or jump straight into the guides to set up your environment, register your first matter, deploy a set, create a kind, and mint your first object.

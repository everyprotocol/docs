# Object Token

---

A token standard for onchain assets that evolve and connect.

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 pt-4">
  <Feature title="Mutable" desc="Transferability shaped NFTs around trading and collecting. Object tokens add mutability — enabling tokens to update, upgrade and evolve over time."/>
  <Feature title="Interoperable" desc="Relations are defined on kinds, not on token contracts or individual object tokens — allowing objects to interact even across different token contracts."/>
  <Feature title="Semantic" desc="Descriptors replace metadata URIs, defining an object’s identity, composition, and interactions — preparing tokens for a human- and AI-driven future."/>
</div>

# Every Protocol

A protocol that facilitates co-creation with object tokens.

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 pt-4">
  <Feature title="Shared Creation Primitives" desc="Objects are constructed from elements, minted from sets, defined by kinds. These primitives form an onchain type system for composable, cross-creator building."/>
  <Feature title="A Social Network of Objects" desc="Creativity doesn’t stop at mint. Kind-level relations let objects interact, remix, build on one another, creating a dynamic network of utility and fun."/>
  <Feature title="Programmable Value Attribution" desc="Creation becomes inherently rewarding: revenue and incentives flow automatically to authors, creators, and contributors according to programmed rules."/>
</div>

# Every Network

A blockchain that powers object tokens on your favorite chains.

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 pt-4">
  <Feature title="Layer E" desc="Every Network extends chains by observing token events and producing token assets deterministically and verifiably. If L1 secures and L2 scales, LE explains."/>
  <Feature title="Object Virtual Machine" desc="OVM computes object assets from their elements and connections, tracing contributors and allocating value. It’s where objects form and value is attributed."/>
  <Feature title="Unified Accounts" desc="Every Network supports unified accounts, allowing users to keep the same address and private key as on the chain where their objects reside."/>
  <Feature title="Proof of Co-Creation" desc="With granular primitives, verifiable assets, traceable contributions, and frictionless value sharing, Every makes co-creation onchain effortless and trustless."/>

title: "Register a Matter"
---

This guide walks you through the process of registering a matter on the Every Testnet.

Since this involves sending a transaction to the Every Network, make sure you’ve already set up a wallet and received some test tokens. See [Set Up Wallets](/get-started/set-up-wallets) if you haven’t done that yet.

## What is a Matter?

A matter is an asset — such as an image, file, 3D model, or any raw content — that can be used programmatically to construct objects in Every Protocol.

To learn more, check the [concepts guide on matters](/learn/concepts/elements#matter).

In this guide, we’ll use a PNG file as an example. You can [download the file]() or use one of your own.

## Register the Matter

### Using the CLI

To register a matter using the CLI:

```bash
every matter register ./path/to/file.png -a eve -u base-sepolia
```

This command will:

* Determine the MIME type and form of the matter from the file extension (you can also specify them manually)
* Determine the target network using the `-u` option
* Use the keystore specified by the `-a` option to sign and submit the transaction
* Wait for the transaction to be finalized and print the emitted events

### Using the Developer Portal
Alternatively, you can register a matter using the Developer Portal:

* Open the [Developer Portal](https://portal.every.fun)
* Click the upper-left corner to switch to the appropriate network (in this case, the testnet)
* Go to the **Developer → Extrinsics** tab
* Select an account to sign the transaction
* Choose the `matter` pallet and the `register(form, mime, blob)` method
* Fill in the required inputs: `form`, `mime`, and `blob`
* Click **Submit Transaction**

## Access the Matter

Matters can be accessed via gateways of the Every Network using their hash. For example, if the matter you registered has the hash `0x3456`, it can be viewed at:

* [https://every.im/matter/0x3456](https://every.im/matter/0x3456)

Gateways can be run by any network participant. Every Labs maintains the following gateways:

| Gateway  | Network |
| -------- | ------- |
| every.bz | Devnet  |
| every.im | Testnet |
| every.fm | Mainnet |

Matters are one of the core building blocks of the protocol. In the following chapters, you’ll see how they are used across various aspects of the protocol, including sets, kinds, and more.

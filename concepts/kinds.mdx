A Kind is a meta-object that defines the structure, appearance, and interactions of a type of objects.

## Kind Object
### Metadata

The metadata of a kind contains essential information about its type and versioning. Every kind is minted from the **Set of Kinds**, with a kind of the **Kind of Kind**.

| Field     | Value                        | Description                                         |
|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `traits`  | `0`                          | Reserved flags                                      |
| `rev`     | `1`                          | Current revision number (initially set to `1`)      |
| `krev`    | `kindOfKind.metadata.rev`    | Revision of the Kind of Kind                        |
| `srev`    | `setOfKind.metadata.rev`     | Revision of the Set of Kind                         |
| `kind`    | `kindOfKind.id`              | ID of the Kind of Kind                              |
| `set`     | `setOfKind.id`               | ID of the Set of Kind                               |

### Elements

Each kind has **6 elements**, defined by the **Kind of Kind**. These elements serve as the core structure for both object typing and asset computation.

| Index | Element   | Type   | Mutable | Description                                               |
|-------|-----------|--------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `0`   | `data`    | Matter | Yes     | Hash of a bundle with committed matters and infos         |
| `1`   | `code`    | Matter | Yes     | Hash of the kind contract                                 |
| `2`   | `skel`    | Info   | No      | Declares the element types for objects of this kind       |
| `3`   | `rels[0]` | Info   | Yes     | Supported relations (part 1)                              |
| `4`   | `rels[1]` | Info   | Yes     | Supported relations (part 2)                              |

## Kind Contract

A **Kind Contract** is a `Matter` written in code form. It defines how an object’s assets are computed from its elements — enabling programmable logic for rendering, validation, or transformation.

Kind contracts are currently written in **AssemblyScript**, compiled to WebAssembly using `kind-as`. A Rust-based compiler is planned for future support.

```ts
@kind
class Hat {
  design: MatterImage;
  background: MatterImage;

  function meta(): Json {
    // return metadata
  }

  function picture(): Image {
    // image with background
  }

  function figure(): Image {
    // image without background
  }
}
```

### Elements

The fields of the contract class define the **elements** of the object. These can be accessed during kind contract execution:

```ts
design: MatterImage;
background: MatterImage;
```

### Facets

The methods exposed by the kind contract are called **facet functions**. Each facet function defines how a specific object asset is computed:

```ts
function picture(): Image {
  // image with background
}
```

Each output is called a **facet image**, and it can be accessed using a **facet selector** — a unique identifier used to dispatch to the correct function.

## Kind Registry

| Operation      | Description                                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `register_kind`| Registers a new kind into the registry.                       |
| `update_kind`  | Updates the mutable elements of an existing kind.             |
| `upgrade_kind` | Applies a new revision of kind or set to the kind object.     |

Welcome to the documentation for Every Protocol - a new paradigm for onchain co-creation.

## Every Protocol

Every Protocol enables creators, developers, builders to collaboratively build, evolve, and interact with digital objects while preserving security, ownership, and provenance.

It's designed to be:
- Intuitive for creators
- Flexible for developers
- Powerful enough to support art, games, AI, identity and more

## Object Tokens

At the core of Every Protocol are Object Tokens, which we call objects for short - next-generation NFTs with type and  semantics.

Key concepts:
- **Kinds** - Define an object's 构成，相貌，行为 (like a type)
- **Sets** - Collections where objects are minted from (like a NFT contracts)
- **Elements** - What makes up an object, can be matter(digigal content from artists), values(fungible tokens) and uniques(traditional NFTs)
- **Relations** - Interactions between objects defined at kind level

These make digital assets programmable, evolvable, interoperable, can be efficiently co-created onchain.

## Every Network

as  objects  evolves or interacts with others, the assets of this objects must be re-computed, almost all general chains do not have vm instructions for computing assets. Every Protocol is powered by the **Every Network** - a blockchain focused on object computation and verification. observer, universe chain.

Key benefits:
- Proof of Co-Creation
- Extending without offloading, Works alongside existing chains (Ethereum, Base, etc)
- Interact with ips already on chains

## What's Next

Continue exploring the core concepts:

- [Objects](/concepts/objects) - The fundamental unit
- [Kinds](/concepts/kinds) - Defining structure
- [Sets](/concepts/sets) - Collections and contracts
- [Relations](/concepts/relations) - Object interactions
- [Matters](/concepts/matters) - Raw assets and content

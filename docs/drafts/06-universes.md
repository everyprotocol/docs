# Universes

In the Previous Network, the blockchains where the implementation contracts of set objects reside are called universes.

The Previous chain itself is not considered a universe. Instead, it functions like a world camera, visualizing tokens and activities on various universes in a cryptographically deterministic way. This approach leverages the existence of numerous fungible and non-fungible tokens and the multitude of activities occurring daily on these established blockchains. Rather than introducing another general-purpose blockchain, the Previous Network aims to facilitate these existing chains and make tokens more visible and interactive.

## Universe ID

Every universe is assigned a unique ID. These universe IDs are mostly based on well-known chain IDs but may have some differences.

## Universes

Currently, the planned universes include:

### Bitcoin Universe

- **Universe ID**: 0

### Ethereum Universe

- **Universe ID**: 1

### Base Universe

- **Universe ID**: 8453

## Test Universes

Test universes are designated for testnets, allowing for experimentation and testing of features without affecting the main networks.

## Dev Universes

Dev universes are intended for local development, providing a sandbox environment for developers to build and test their applications.

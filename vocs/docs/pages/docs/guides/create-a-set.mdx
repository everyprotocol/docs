title: "Create a Set"
---

a set is where object tokens minted from. it is a token contract conforming to object token standard, and registered at the set registry.

objects from a set must have a kind, can be constructed from elements.

we will show how to define a kind in later chapters, for now, we just use an existing kind(the kind of dice, kind id = 18).

every objects minted from this set, will be constructed from two elements, one is a matter in form of image, the other is just an piece of information. we've learned how to register a matter in the previous chapter, the information is a element which don't need to be registered.


## determine the kind

## register matters for later use

## write a set contract

forge build

every set register

## register the set

## mint an object

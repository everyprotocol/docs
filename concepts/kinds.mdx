A **Kind** is a meta-object that defines the **structure, appearance, and interactions** of a group of objects. It serves as the blueprint — determining what elements an object has, how its assets are computed, and how it interacts with other objects.

## Metadata

The metadata of a kind contains essential information about its type and versioning.

| Field     | Value                   | Description                              |
|-----------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `flags`   | `0`                     | Status flags (reserved for future use)   |
| `rev`     | `1`                     | Current revision number                  |
| `kindRev` | `latestKindOfKind()`    | Revision of the Kind of Kind             |
| `setRev`  | `latestSetOfKind()`     | Revision of the Set of Kind              |
| `kind`    | `ID_KIND_OF_KIND`       | Kind ID (always points to Kind of Kind)  |
| `set`     | `ID_SET_OF_KIND`        | Set ID (always points to Set of Kind)    |

## Elements

Each kind has **6 elements**. These elements are defined by its own kind — the **Kind of Kind** — and serve as building blocks for both definition and execution.

| Index | Element   | Type   | Mutable | Description                                                 |
|-------|-----------|--------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0`   | `shape`   | Info   | No      | Declares element types for objects of this kind             |
| `1`   | `code`    | Matter | Yes     | Hash of the kind contract                                   |
| `2`   | `bundle`  | Matter | Yes     | Hash of a bundle, containing committed matters and infos    |
| `3`   | `rels0`   | Info   | Yes     | Supported relations (part 1)                                |
| `4`   | `rels1`   | Info   | Yes     | Supported relations (part 2)                                |

## Kind Contract

A **Kind Contract** is a `Matter` in code form that defines how an object's assets are derived from its elements. It provides programmable logic for rendering, verification, or computation, enabling dynamic and expressive objects.

Kind contracts can currently be written in **AssemblyScript**, compiled to WebAssembly using `kind-as`. A Rust toolkit is planned but not yet available.

```ts
@kind
class Hat {
  design: MatterImage;
  background: MatterImage;

  function meta(): Json {
    // return metadata
  }

  function picture(): Image {
    // compute main image
  }

  function figure(): Image {
    // compute figure
  }
}
```

 * Facet Function: The universal entry point of a kind contract. Used for rendering, computation, verification, etc.
 * Facet Selector: A unique identifier (e.g. function signature) used to dispatch calls to the facet function.
 * Facet Image: An image or asset dynamically generated by the kind contract from object elements like matter or gene.

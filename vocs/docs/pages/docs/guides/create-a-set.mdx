# Create a Set

A **set** is the contract from which object tokens are minted in Every Protocol.
It is a token contract that conforms to the Object Token standard and must be registered in the Set Registry.

- Each set is assigned a unique **set ID** when registered.
- Each object minted from a set must specify a **kind** and its **elements**, emitted as events defined by the Object Token standard.
- The full logic is implemented as a contract deployed on a **universe chain**, called the **set contract**.

This guide demonstrates how to write a set contract, register it in the Set Registry, and mint objects from it.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:

1. A kind already created (see [Create a Kind](/docs/guides/create-a-kind))
2. A [wallet set up](/docs/guides/set-up-wallets) and funded with tokens

## Write a Set Contract

### 1. Initialize a project

Initialize a new set contract project from the template:

```bash
forge init --template everytemplate/set dice-set
```

```bash
cd dice-set
forge build
```

### 2. Implement contract logic

Edit the contract in src/ to define your set’s logic and behavior.
For this example we’ll use DiceSet.sol.

## Register the Set

### 1. Deploy the contract
```bash
forge create src/DiceSet.sol:DiceSet \
  --rpc-url http://anvil.localhost \
  --account charlie \
  --constructor-args 0x854C35Fd2b65fE9fcE71dddE91De8c3e1A7Dc8Ae 17 1
```

### 2. Register it in the Set Registry

Once deployed, register the set contract in the Set Registry:

```bash
every set register \
  0x0DCd1Bf9A1b36cE34237eEaFef220932846BCD82 \
  0x7aac8eb4c87ba294324476e11b6bc12787951c4e20a0b4a9966377a1c8381674 \
  --foundry --account charlie --universe anvil
```
The first argument is the set contract address
	•	The second is the kind hash
	•	--foundry tells the CLI to use Foundry’s keystore
	•	--universe specifies the target chain

## Work with Objects

### 1. Mint objects

With the set registered, you can mint new objects from it.

First, encode the element values:
```bash
cast abi-encode 'fn(bytes32[])' \
  '[0xffaaeb0dc1385d1d515c5cc2f2da4a370f644fc75796913a066782e833b19aa8,0xffaaeb0dc1385d1d515c5cc2f2da4a370f644fc75796913a066782e833b19aa8]'
```

### 2. Update objects

Then call the create function on the set contract:
```bash
cast send \
  --rpc-url http://anvil.localhost \
  --account alice \
  0x0DCd1Bf9A1b36cE34237eEaFef220932846BCD82 \
  'create(address,uint64,bytes calldata)' \
  0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 \
  0 \
  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020\
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002ffaa\
eb0dc1385d1d515c5cc2f2da4a370f644fc75796913a066782e833b19aa8ffaaeb0d\
c1385d1d515c5cc2f2da4a370f644fc75796913a066782e833b19aa8
```

### 3. Access object assets

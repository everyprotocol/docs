Elements are the actual components of an object. Each element can represent digital content used by the object, a token wrapped inside the object, or arbitrary data associated with the object.

Elements fall into four categories:

- **Matter** — Digital content (e.g. media, code)
- **Value** — Fungible tokens
- **Unique** — Traditional non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Since objects themselves are NFTs, *Unique* refers to non-object NFTs.
- **Info** — Arbitrary data

All elements are encoded as 32-byte values when stored in token contracts.

## Element Types

### Matter

Matter elements represent cryptographically committed content stored on the Every Network. Each object that includes a matter element references it by its hash.

**Structure:**

| Field      | Type        | Description                             |
|------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `form`     | `uint8`     | Format or encoding type                 |
| `mime`     | `string31`  | MIME type (31-byte, zero-padded)       |
| `content`  | `bytes`     | The actual media or content            |

**Forms:**

**Hashing formula:**
Only the hash is stored in the token contract. The actual content is stored on the Every Network and is loaded and processed by kind contracts to compute the object’s assets.



### Value

A value element represents an amount of fungible tokens wrapped by the object. The token must be registered in the **Element Registry** and referenced by its token index. The **set contract** is responsible for ensuring that the object is backed by the correct token balance.

**Structure:**

| Field       | Type        | Description                                      |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `token`     | `uint64`    | Index of the registered token contract           |
| `reserved`  | `uint64`    | Reserved (must be zero)                          |
| `amount`    | `uint128`   | Amount of tokens wrapped (max: 2¹²⁸ − 1)         |

**Note:** This differs from many token standards that use `uint256` for balances. However, `uint128` is sufficient for almost all practical use cases.

### Unique

Unique elements represent non-fungible tokens wrapped by the object. Like value elements, they refer to a registered NFT contract and must be backed by the set contract.

**Structure:**

| Field     | Type      | Description                                  |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| `token`   | `uint64`  | Index of the registered NFT contract         |
| `id`      | `uint64`  | Token ID of the NFT                          |
| `amount`  | `uint128` | Quantity (must be `1` for ERC721-style NFTs) |

### Info

Info elements are arbitrary 32-byte data fields stored directly on the object.


## Element Registry

These fields can be read by set contracts on the universe chain and can also be interpreted or processed by kind contracts on the Every Network.

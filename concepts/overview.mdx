Welcome to Every Protocol - a new paradigm for onchain co-creation.

## Every Protocol

// ai!, this should be: every protocol enables aa bb cc to collaboratively, securely build digital assets that can evolve, interact with others.
Every Protocol enables creators, developers, and builders to collaboratively build, evolve, and interact with digital objects while preserving security, ownership, and provenance.

It's designed to be:
- Intuitive for creators
- Flexible for developers
- Powerful enough to support art, games, AI, and identity systems

## Object Tokens

At the core of Every Protocol are Object Tokens (objects for short) - next-generation NFTs with built-in structure and semantics.

Key concepts:
- **Kinds** - Define an object's composition, appearance, and behavior (like a type system)
- **Elements** - An object's components including:
  - Matter (digital content)
  - Values (fungible tokens)
  - Uniques (traditional NFTs)
  - Info (Arbitrary data)
- **Sets** - Collections where objects are minted (like NFT contracts)
- **Relations** - Interactions between objects defined at the kind level

These features enable programmable, evolvable, and interoperable digital assets that can be efficiently co-created onchain.

## Every Network

As objects evolve and interact, their underlying assets must be recomputed. The Every Network provides this capability as a specialized blockchain for object computation and verification.

Key benefits:
- Proof of Co-Creation
- Extends existing chains (Ethereum, Base, etc) without migration
- Interoperates with existing onchain IP

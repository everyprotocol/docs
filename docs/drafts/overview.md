Every Protocol enables intuitive, collaborative, secure, and rewarding onchain co-creation.

It introduces the Object Token (or simply, object) — a next-gen token with structure, semantics, and interoperability. Each object has a kind, is minted from a set, and is composed of elements. Objects can interact with one another through relations defined at the kind level. Every aspect of an object can be created or developed by anyone, unlocking true onchain collaboration.

As objects mutate, evolve, and interact — even with traditional tokens — their underlying assets are re-computed securely. The content, the materials involved, and the creators themselves are all publicly verifiable. This mechanism is called proof of co-creation — making Every Protocol ideal for collaborative creation, IP licensing, and shared ownership.

The Every Network is the blockchain that powers the protocol — but it works differently. Instead of pulling creators into a new chain, it allows them to deploy set contracts on the chains they already love. The Every Network then observes these chains, extending their capabilities without offloading transactions.

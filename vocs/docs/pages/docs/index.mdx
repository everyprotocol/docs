A new paradigm of co-creation.

## Object Token

Object Tokens (or simply *objects*) are structured, programmable, evolving onchain assets.  
They replace opaque metadata with a shared, semantic model designed for collaboration.

Objects are built from four primitives:

- **Elements** – the components of an object  
  - **Matter** — digital assets (images, models, code, data, etc.)  
  - **Values** — fungible balances  
  - **Uniques** — unique non-fungible elements  
  - **Info** — arbitrary data  
- **Sets** – where objects are minted (similar to NFT contracts)  
- **Kinds** – define an object’s structure and logic  
- **Relations** – define how objects connect and interact

Objects can evolve, interact with others, and compose across creators — a foundation for art, games, AI agents, identity systems, and more.

## Every Protocol

Every Protocol defines the shared rules for creating, updating, and connecting Object Tokens.  
It provides:

- **Shared creation primitives** — elements, sets, kinds, and relations  
- **A unified onchain type system** for humans and AIs  
- **Cross-creator composability** through kind-level interactions  
- **Co-creation** — objects that remix, combine, and build on one another  
- **Programmable value attribution** — contributions rewarded automatically  

This is the layer where objects come to life, connect, and accumulate meaning.

## Every Network

As objects evolve and interact, their assets must be recomputed and verified.  
The **Every Network** is a blockchain built specifically to power these computations.

It provides:

- **Layer E** — observes object events on other chains and computes assets deterministically  
- **Object Virtual Machine (OVM)** — executes kind contracts and computes assets from elements and relations  
- **Proof of Co-Creation (PoCC)** — verifiable creation history and contribution tracing  
- **Programmable value flows** — value routed automatically by programmable rules  
- **Unified accounts** — users keep the same address as the chain where objects originate  
- **Shadow Execution** — enhances existing chains without absorbing their transactions

This is the execution layer that ensures object assets are deterministic, verifiable, and attributable.

## What’s Next?

From here, you can explore:

- **How Object Tokens are structured**
- **How to create kinds, sets, and relations**
- **How the OVM computes assets**
- **How PoCC distributes value**
- **How to mint your first object**

Let's dive in.

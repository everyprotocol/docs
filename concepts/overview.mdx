Welcome to Every Protocol, a new paradigm for onchain co-creation.

## Every Protocol

Every Protocol empowers creators, developers, and builders to collaboratively and securely build digital assets that can evolve and interact with one another.

It’s designed to be:
- Intuitive for creators
- Flexible for developers
- Powerful enough to support art, games, AI systems, and identity frameworks

## Object Token

At the core of Every Protocol are **Object Tokens** (or simply, *objects*) — next-generation NFTs with structure and semantics.

Key Concepts:
- **Kinds** — Define an object’s composition, appearance, and behavior (like a type system)
- **Elements** — The components that make up an object:
  - **Matter** – digital content (e.g. image, model, code)
  - **Values** – fungible token balances
  - **Uniques** – unique non-fungible elements
  - **Info** – arbitrary data or metadata
- **Sets** — Collections from which objects are minted (similar to NFT contracts)
- **Relations** — Interactions between objects, defined at the kind level

These features make objects not only programmable, evolvable, and interoperable — but also enable efficient, trustless co-creation onchain.

## Every Network

As objects evolve and interact, their underlying assets need to be re-computed. The **Every Network** powers this process — a specialized blockchain for object computation and verification.

Key Benefits:
- **Proof of Co-Creation** — Verifiable changes to objects and their contributors
- **Interoperability** — Works seamlessly with objects from other vendors, existing onchain IP, and standards
- **Shadow Execution** — Enhances existing chains (Ethereum, Base, etc.) without offloading their transactions

## What’s Next

Dive into the core concepts:
- [**Objects**](/concepts/objects) — The fundamental unit of the protocol
- [**Kinds**](/concepts/kinds) — Define the structure and rules of objects
- [**Elements**](/concepts/elements) — The building blocks of objects
- [**Sets**](/concepts/sets) — Where objects are minted
- [**Relations**](/concepts/relations) — How objects connect and interact

Let’s get started.

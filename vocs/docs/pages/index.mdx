# Object Token

---

A token standard for structured, semantic objects — mutable, upgradeable, and interoperable, built for humans and AIs

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 pt-4">
  <Feature title="Mutable" desc="AERC-721 and 1155 shaped NFTs around trading and collecting. Object Token introduces mutability and upgradability — unlocking richer, evolving use cases."/>
  <Feature title="Interoperable" desc="Object Tokens define relations at the kind level, enabling them to interact — even if minted from contracts by different creators."/>
  <Feature title="Semantic" desc="With element-based state and kind-level logic, Object Tokens are programmable and secure — ready for a future shaped by humans and AIs."/>
</div>

# Every Protocol

Every Protocol powers onchain co-creation — with composable objects, reusable logic, programmable revenue, and shared rewards

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 pt-4">
  <Feature title="Co-creation made simple" desc="Every Protocol defines elements, kinds, sets, and relations — enabling creators, developers to build together. Every contribution is onchain and composable."/>
  <Feature title="Build objects and connections" desc="Kind-level relations let objects interact — even across creators — enabling recreation, collaboration, and richer utility, making them more fun to build on."/>
  <Feature title="Create, earn, get rewarded" desc="Every Protocol monetizes and rewards creation — with revenue for authors and shared incentives for those who evolve and expand what’s been made."/>
</div>

# Every Network

Every Network extends chains by computing object assets — enabling attributable and verifiable co-creation

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 pt-4">
  <Feature title="Projection Layer" desc="Every Network isn’t a competing Layer 1 or a offloading Layer 2. It’s a projection layer extending chains by executing kind contracts and rendering the “images” of objects."/>
  <Feature title="Unified Accounts" desc="Every Network supports multiple chains and unified accounts, users keep the same address and signing key as on the chain their token contracts live on."/>
  <Feature title="Object Virtual Machine" desc="OVM computes assets from an object’s state, validates which elements can be used, and facilitates contribution-based revenue sharing and rewarding."/>
  <Feature title="Proof of Co-Creation" desc="Every Network is a PoCC chain — crediting pre-mint contributions, tracing post-mint recreations, and ensuring transparent, verifiable ownership and value flow."/>

# Set Up Wallets

To interact with Every Protocol, you’ll need a wallet. Wallets let you sign transactions and manage assets on both:

- Universe chains (such as Ethereum or Base)
- The observer chain (Every Network)

Every Network supports [unified accounts](/docs/network/accounts), so you can use the same address and private key across both types of chains.

You can either import an existing account or create a new one — using a browser extension or the CLI.

## Use Wallet Extensions

The easiest way to get started is with a browser wallet extension. We recommend:

- [SubWallet](https://subwallet.app)
- [Talisman](https://talisman.xyz)

These support both **Substrate accounts** and **Ethereum accounts**. With them, you can:

- Create a new wallet from scratch
- Import an existing wallet with a seed phrase or private key

## Use the CLI

You can also generate or import a wallet from the terminal using the `every` CLI.
If you don’t have it installed yet, run:

:::code-group
```bash [bun]
bun a -g @everyprotocol/every-cli
```
```bash [npm]
npm i -g @everyprotocol/every-cli
```
:::

### Generate a new wallet

In the examples below we use eve as the wallet name — feel free to choose your own.

```bash
every wallet new eve -t ethereum
```

### Import an existing wallet

```bash
every wallet import eve PRIVATE_KEY -t ethereum
```

### Inspect your wallet

```bash
every wallet inspect eve
```

Sample output:

```bash
every wallet inspect eve
Password:
   Keystore: ~/.every/keystores/eve
 Store Type: substrate
   Key Type: ethereum
    Address: 0xD6f31D659F2aC7E72De23423f97874a13ec8D74F
 Public Key: 0x035b469096f3bf96f89f4e7cbdcb104b220ee3c2335cf36fe2e37747fc4c0b4c09
```

## Get Testnet Tokens

Once your wallet is ready, you can request testnet tokens:

1. Visit [Every faucet](https://faucet.every.fun)
2. Paste your wallet address and click **Request**

## Check Your Balance

You can check balances either via the Developer Portal or the CLI.

### Developer Portal

1.	Open the [Developer Portal](https://portal.every.fun)
2.	Go to **Accounts** → **Accounts** to view balances for all accounts injected by your wallet
3.	To check any other address, go to  **Accounts** → **Address Book**, add the address, and view its balance

### CLI

```bash
every balance 0xD6f31D659F2aC7E72De23423f97874a13ec8D74F --network devnet
```
With your wallet set up and funded, you’re ready to interact with Every Protocol.

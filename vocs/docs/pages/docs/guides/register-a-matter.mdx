# Register a Matter

This guide walks you through the process of registering a matter on the Every Network.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:

1. Learned the [concepts of matters](/docs/concepts/elements#matter)
2. Set up a wallet and funded it with testnet tokens (see [Set Up Wallets](/docs/guides/set-up-wallets))

## Understanding Matters

A **matter** is an asset — such as an image, file, 3D model, or any raw content — that can be used programmatically to construct objects in Every Protocol.

In this guide, we’ll use a PNG file as an example. You can [download the sample file]() or use one of your own.

## Registering a Matter

To register a matter using the CLI:

```bash
every matter register ./path/to/file.png -a eve -u base-sepolia
```

This command will:
-	Determine the MIME type and form of the matter from the file extension (you can also specify them manually)
- Determine the target network using the -u option
- Use the keystore specified by the -a option to sign and submit the transaction
- Wait for the transaction to be finalized and print the emitted events

## Accessing the Matter

Once registered, matters can be accessed via Every Network gateways using their hash. For example, if the matter you registered has the hash 0x3456, it can be viewed at:

- [https://every.im/matter/0x3456](https://every.im/matter/0x3456)

Gateways can be run by any network participant. Every Labs maintains the following gateways:

| Gateway  | Network |
| -------- | ------- |
| every.bz | Devnet  |
| every.im | Testnet |
| every.fm | Mainnet |

Matters are foundational to the protocol, and in the following chapters you’ll see how they are used in sets, kinds, and more.

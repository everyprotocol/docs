Welcome to the documentation for Every Protocol - a paradigm for onchain co-creation.

## What is Every Protocol?

Every Protocol enables creators and AI to collaboratively build, evolve, and interact with digital objects while preserving security, ownership, and provenance.

It's designed to be:
- Intuitive for creators
- Flexible for developers
- Powerful enough to support art, games, AI, identity and more

## Object Tokens

At the core of Every Protocol are **Object Tokens**, which we call objects for short - next-generation NFTs with built-in structure and behavior.

Key concepts:
- **Kinds** - Define an object's structure and behavior (like a class)
- **Sets** - Collections objects are minted from (like contracts)
- **Elements** - An object's components (media, values, metadata)
- **Relations** - Links between objects that enable interaction

These make digital assets programmable, interoperable and evolvable.

## The Every Network

Every Protocol is powered by the **Every Network** - a blockchain focused on object computation and verification.

Key benefits:
- Works alongside existing chains (Ethereum, Base, etc)
- Brings new capabilities without migration
- Maintains security and provenance

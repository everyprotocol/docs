# Resources

These tools form part of the Every Protocol developer toolkit.

## [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/)

Used to write **kind contracts** that compile to WebAssembly, giving developers a familiar TypeScript-like syntax.

## [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

Our preferred **package manager and runtime**. We use Bun to bootstrap kind contract projects from GitHub templates, and it powers much of our dev teamâ€™s workflow.

## [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh)

We use `forge`, `cast`, and `anvil` for **set contract development**. `forge` is used to initialize projects from GitHub templates, the `every` CLI integrates natively with Foundry wallets.

## [JSON5](https://json5.org/)

A concise, human-friendly way to input and output JSON data. The `every` CLI uses JSON5 in some commands to make input/output easier to work with.

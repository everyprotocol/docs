Welcome to Every Protocol - a new paradigm for onchain co-creation.

## Every Protocol

Every Protocol enables creators, developers, and builders to collaboratively build, evolve, and interact with digital objects while preserving security, ownership, and provenance.

It's designed to be:
- Intuitive for creators
- Flexible for developers
- Powerful enough to support art, games, AI, and identity systems

## Object Tokens

At the core of Every Protocol are Object Tokens (objects for short) - next-generation NFTs with built-in structure and semantics.

Key concepts:
- **Kinds** - Define an object's composition, appearance, and behavior (like a type system)
- **Sets** - Collections where objects are minted (like NFT contracts)
- **Elements** - An object's components including:
  - Matter (digital content)
  - Values (fungible tokens)
  - Uniques (traditional NFTs)
- **Relations** - Interactions between objects defined at the kind level

These features enable programmable, evolvable, and interoperable digital assets that can be efficiently co-created onchain.

## Every Network

As objects evolve and interact, their underlying assets must be recomputed. The Every Network provides this capability as a specialized blockchain for object computation and verification.

Key benefits:
- Proof of Co-Creation
- Extends existing chains (Ethereum, Base, etc) without migration
- Interoperates with existing onchain IP

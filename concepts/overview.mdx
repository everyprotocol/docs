Welcome to the documentation for Every Protocol.

## Every Protocol

Every Protocol is a new standard for onchain co-creation. It enables people to collaboratively build, evolve, and interact with digital objects — all while preserving security, ownership, and provenance.

It’s designed to be intuitive for creators, flexible for developers, and powerful enough to support everything from art and games to AI and identity.

## Object Tokens

At the heart of Every Protocol is the **Object Token** — or simply, *object*.
Objects are next-generation NFTs with built-in structure and behavior. Each object:

- Has a **kind** – like a class or blueprint
- Is minted from a **set** – like a contract or collection
- Is composed of **elements** – such as images, values, metadata, and unique IDs
- Can form **relations** – links to other objects, sets, or kinds

These concepts — _objects, kinds, sets, elements,_ and _relations_ — make digital assets programmable, interoperable, and evolvable.

## Every Network

To support these advanced features, Every Protocol is powered by the **Every Network** — a blockchain focused on the computation and verification of object content.

Instead of asking creators to switch chains, the Every Network watches existing ones (like Ethereum or Base), enabling them to deploy where they’re already active. It brings new capabilities to existing ecosystems without disrupting workflows.

## What’s Next

In the sections that follow, we’ll walk through the core concepts of Every Protocol:

- **Objects** — the fundamental unit of creation
- **Kinds** — the definitions that give objects structure
- **Sets** — collections that objects are minted from
- **Relations** — how objects connect and interact
- **Universes** — the environments where objects live
- **Matters** — the raw assets that power objects

Understanding these building blocks will help you create, extend, and collaborate with object tokens — and unlock the full potential of Every Protocol.

Let’s get started.

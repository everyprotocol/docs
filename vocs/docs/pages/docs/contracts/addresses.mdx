# Addresses

Core contracts of Every Protocol are deployed on universe chains.
They can then be observed and explained by the Every Network, the reference observer chain.

## Ethereum

The following core contracts are deployed on both **Ethereum Mainnet** and **Base**.
Addresses are kept identical across these chains for consistency.

| Contract        | Address                                      |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| SetRegistry     | `0x854C35Fd2b65fE9fcE71dddE91De8c3e1A7Dc8Ae` |
| OmniRegistry    | `0x4b7fc108F2c4fCDD990240448D2eED8034713c7D` |
| KindRegistry    | `0x7A8B3E5A9c227858C5917b7de8ba1684Cd868630` |
| ElementRegistry | `0x8De1EE1dbAE2Ffd1CAe1e6bA83E6cAede1461507` |
| ObjectMinter    | `0x12CaBC370b316F247126F3Fab529Ee25e03aE226` |

## Base

Same as Ethereum (see above).

## Sepolia

Testnet deployments of the same core contracts, mirrored across **Sepolia** and **Base Sepolia** with the same addresses.

| Contract        | Address                                      |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| SetRegistry     | `0x854C35Fd2b65fE9fcE71dddE91De8c3e1A7Dc8Ae` |
| OmniRegistry    | `0x4b7fc108F2c4fCDD990240448D2eED8034713c7D` |
| KindRegistry    | `0x7A8B3E5A9c227858C5917b7de8ba1684Cd868630` |
| ElementRegistry | `0x8De1EE1dbAE2Ffd1CAe1e6bA83E6cAede1461507` |
| ObjectMinter    | `0x12CaBC370b316F247126F3Fab529Ee25e03aE226` |

## Base Sepolia

Same as Sepolia (see above).

## Anvil

For local development, you can deploy the contracts yourself using Anvil.
Addresses will vary depending on your deployment.

// ai!, no need a level 1 title, remember this when writing mintlify docs
# Welcome

// ai! standard => paradiam
Welcome to the documentation for Every Protocol - a new standard for onchain co-creation.

## What is Every Protocol?

// ai! change people to reflect that it is applicable for both humans and ai
Every Protocol enables people to collaboratively build, evolve, and interact with digital objects while preserving security, ownership, and provenance.

It's designed to be:
- Intuitive for creators
- Flexible for developers
- Powerful enough to support art, games, AI, identity and more

## Object Tokens
// ai! avoid using paranthesis, but still introduce we use objects for short afterwards
At the core of Every Protocol are **Object Tokens** (or simply *objects*) - next-generation NFTs with built-in structure and behavior.

Key concepts:
- **Kinds** - Define an object's structure and behavior (like a class)
- **Sets** - Collections objects are minted from (like contracts)
- **Elements** - An object's components (media, values, metadata)
- **Relations** - Links between objects that enable interaction

These make digital assets programmable, interoperable and evolvable.

## The Every Network

Every Protocol is powered by the **Every Network** - a blockchain focused on object computation and verification.

Key benefits:
- Works alongside existing chains (Ethereum, Base, etc)
- Brings new capabilities without migration
- Maintains security and provenance

## What's Next

// ai! remove universes, we will cover this concept in the advanced part
Continue exploring the core concepts:

- [Objects](/concepts/objects) - The fundamental unit
- [Kinds](/concepts/kinds) - Defining structure
- [Sets](/concepts/sets) - Collections and contracts
- [Relations](/concepts/relations) - Object interactions
- [Universes](/concepts/universes) - Deployment environments
- [Matters](/concepts/matters) - Raw assets and content

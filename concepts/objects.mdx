The OpenZeppelin documentation[^note] provides a clear explanation of the distinction between tokens and token contracts:

> *Token contracts are smart contracts that manage token balances and operations, while tokens themselves are the digital assets represented by those balances.*

[^note]: [OpenZeppelin Docs – Tokens](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/tokens)

Compared to existing standards, **object tokens** store more structured and extensible data within token contracts. Additionally, data related to **interoperations** — often involving multiple token contracts — is maintained in a shared onchain contract called the **Omni Registry**.

## Storage

Different token standards store different kinds of data in their contracts. Object tokens introduce a richer structure at the contract level and delegate shared operations — like positioning and connections — to the **Omni Registry**.

| Standard    | Token Contract Storage                                                  | Omni Registry Storage         |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **ERC20**   | `map(owner => balance)`                                                 | —                             |
| **ERC721**  | `map(id => owner)`<br/>`map(id => uri)`                                 | —                             |
| **ERC1155** | `map(owner => id => balance)`<br/>`map(id => uri)`                      | —                             |
| **Objects** | `map(id => owner)`<br/>`map(id => metadata)`<br/>`map(id => elements)`  | `map(id => position)`         |

## Properties

The table below outlines the key properties tracked by various token types. Object tokens extend this list with composable content, structured metadata, and spatial logic.

| Property     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **id**       | A unique identifier within a set (non-fungible only)                        |
| **owner**    | The address that currently owns the token                                   |
| **balance**  | Amount held by an address (for fungible or semi-fungible tokens)            |
| **uri**      | A metadata URI (used in ERC721 and ERC1155 only)                            |
| **metadata** | Structured metadata stored onchain (unique to object tokens)                |
| **elements** | Modular components such as matter, values, uniques, and info                |
| **position** | Logical or spatial location, used for linking and layout                    |

## Operations

We're already familiar with standard operations like `mint`, `transfer`, and `burn`.
Object tokens introduce additional operations that support **mutation**, **evolution**, and **interoperation** — all native to the protocol.

| Operation    | Description                                              | Implemented In     | Affected Properties                     |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **mint**     | Create a new object from a set                           | Token Contract      | `owner`, `metadata`, `elements`         |
| **transfer** | Change the ownership of an object                        | Token Contract      | `owner`                                  |
| **burn**     | Permanently remove an object                             | Token Contract      | `owner`, `metadata`                      |
| **update**   | Modify an object’s metadata or elements                  | Token Contract      | `metadata`, `elements`                   |
| **upgrade**  | Apply kind-defined upgrades to the object                | Token Contract      | `metadata`                               |
| **relate**   | Establish a relation between objects                     | Omni Registry       | `position`                               |
| **unrelate** | Remove a relation between objects                        | Omni Registry       | `position`                               |
| **move**     | Change an object’s spatial or logical position           | Omni Registry       | `position`                               |
